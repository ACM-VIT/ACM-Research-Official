Hi, I am Vidit Kothari, a CSE Core fresher studying at VIT, Vellore.
I am interested in doing research in Quantum Computing, and currently am working on an app dev project.

The Project Idea:
An app for musicians, and basically all kinds of artists, to go live and get connected with random strangers on a video call. 
The artists will display their art, be it music, spoken word or anything, and the random strangers can rate them on a scale of 1 to 10. 
A leaderboard can be maintained for each category, like Music, Standup, etc. 
They can also compete head on with each other for a certain duration, like for 30 minutes, 
whoever gets the highest ratings, or whoever has the highest average rating, from multiple video chats, wins.
